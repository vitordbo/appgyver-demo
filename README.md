# Using AppGyver
AppGyver is a no-code application development environment designed for anyone to quickly develop apps with drag-and-drop

* Here's the main page

* At first is just drag a view component from the component library on the left and drop it onto the view canvas in the middle. The components could be moved and deleted

* You can download the AppGyver Preview app on your mobile device to preview the app preview on your phone or tablet

* You can select a view component on the view canvas, for example a text and change it on the right

* You can change component styles it's just select a view component on the view canvas, for example a Button and open the style tab in the properties panel

Now that the user view is almost there you can start adding some functionality to your app

* To open the logic canvas, select a component  (or the page) and click the Add logic bar at the bottom of the view canvas. Just like the gif

* All logic is built with logic flows: series of interconnected nodes that start with an event node, then proceed through a series of flow function nodes to determine what happens in your app. 

* After that it's just connect the logic nodes by clicking and dragging a wire from one of the outputs to another node's input.
